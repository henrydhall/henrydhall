- Hello there, I’m Henry Hall. I'm pursuing a degree in applied math from BYU with a minor in computer science. I'm looking for work as a security analyst intern, but I'd be happy doing anything with software and technology. 
- I’m currently learning .NET Core and Entity Framework Core. I have experience in C/C++, Python, SQL/CCL, some web development, and some Java a long time ago.
- I’m looking to collaborate on really anything, especially cyber security.
- You can reach me at henrydhall3.14@gmail.com
