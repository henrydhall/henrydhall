- Hello there, Iâ€™m Henry Hall. My degree is in applied mathematics and computer science from Weber State.
- I am working as a Technology Service Analyst for Zions Bancorp. Most of my attention goes to there, so that commit history isn't public.
- Mostly right now I'm just messing around and doing personal projects that interest me and help me develop new skills.
- Currently working on a game with PyGame.
- I have experience in Python and web development with Flask. I worked with C/C++, SQL, and a little MongoDB in school.
- I have a lot of academic exposure to cryptography.
- You can reach me at henrydhall3.14@gmail.com

## Private Repositories
Because these are projects which were originally school work, I have made them private. Please feel free to reach out and I will get access for you.
- Relational Database Demo
- 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon
- Bomblab

I have a number of projects that I've used to help with Imaging Projects that have problems while I've been with FamilySearch. These include image processors to make sure images can be imported to our system, correcting naming conventions in projects, and reorganizing projects that were created incorrectly. If you'd like to see these feel free to reach out and we could chat about them.
