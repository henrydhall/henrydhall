- Hello there, I’m Henry Hall. I'm pursuing a degree in applied mathematics and computer science from Weber State.
- Currently working as a Digital Image Processing Intern.
- Mostly right now I'm just messing around and doing personal projects that interest me and help me develop new skills, and taking CS classes.
- I'm in a mathematical cryptography course.
- Currently working on some full stack Python applications. 
- I have experience in C/C++, Python, SQL, a little MongoDB, and I've seen some Dotnet Core. I've done web development with Python/Flask.
- I’m looking to collaborate on really anything, especially cyber security.
- You can reach me at henrydhall3.14@gmail.com

## Private Repositories
Because these are projects which were originally school work, I have made them private. Please feel free to reach out and I will get access for you.
