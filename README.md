- Hello there, I’m Henry Hall. I'm pursuing a degree in applied mathematics from Weber State. I'm looking for work as a security analyst intern, but I'd be happy doing anything with software and technology. 
- Mostly right now I'm just messing around and doing personal projects that interest me and help me develop new skills.
- I’m currently working to expand my knowledge/experience with databases with SQLite 3. Specifically I've been connecting that to Python applications, and my goal is to expand some or all of those projects to full stack projects. 
- I have experience in C/C++, Python, SQL/CCL, and I've seen some Dotnet Core. I've done some web development, and some work in Java a long time ago.
- I’m looking to collaborate on really anything, especially cyber security.
- You can reach me at henrydhall3.14@gmail.com

## Private Repositories
Because these are projects which were originally school work, I have made them private. Please feel free to reach out and I will get access for you.
