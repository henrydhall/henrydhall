- Hello there, I’m Henry Hall. I'm pursuing a degree in applied mathematics from Weber State. I'm looking for work as a security analyst intern, but I'd be happy doing anything with software and technology. 
- Mostly right now I'm just messing around and doing personal projects that interest me and help me develop new skills, and taking CS classes.
- I'm in an introduction to mathematical cryptography math course.
- I'm taking an advanced database class, a networking class, and a formal languages and algorightms class.
- Currently working on some full stack Python applications. 
- I have experience in C/C++, Python, SQL/CCL, and I've seen some Dotnet Core. I've done web development with Python/Flask, and some class work in Java a long time ago.
- I’m looking to collaborate on really anything, especially cyber security.
- You can reach me at henrydhall3.14@gmail.com
